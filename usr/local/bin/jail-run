Shortcut to firejail to bind a program to a given network with a fixed IP.
Waits for internet access to be available before launching the program.
Useful for LAN games between host and a VM guest.

Needs firejail installed!

Example:
        jail-run bridge0 192.168.100.230 minecraft
	(This assumes that bridge0 uses subnet 192.168.100.0/24 and the given IP is not in use)
